# NBA History App

I built this (very simple) javascript app which allows you to compare the history of two NBA teams, since the 1976 NBA-ABA merger. This idea was inspired by Dorktown (Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein), and their 7-part documentary [History of the Atlanta Falcons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx_ORMhpmoU&list=PLUXSZMIiUfFSzzgEL4N9aYBXPmGVen3zW).

The data was collected using a simply python script, included in this repository, which scrapes [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

You can play around with the site [here](https://pkseeg.github.io/nba-history-app/).
